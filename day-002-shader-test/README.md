# Day 2 Notes

### Platform
This code is to be used in Processing. The Arduino code uses the serial port and was built for rotary encoders. Be sure to upload the arduino code to the microcontroller. The project was created with Processing, Arduino, and GLSL.

### Folder Structure
The folder stucture for the Processing file needs to be maintained or updated if changed. The Arduino file does not matter since it uses the serial connection.
